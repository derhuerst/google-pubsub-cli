# google-pubsub-cli

**Publish to [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topics and read from subscriptions.** Like `gcloud pubsub topics publish` & `gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull`, but

- works with the [Pub/Sub emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator) via the `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable,
- supports taking messages line-wise via `stdin`.
